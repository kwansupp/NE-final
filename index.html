                        <p class="mb-15">Modderkolk would like to become an ever-flourishing company that can double the revenue and quadruple the profit in a 4-year timespan. To reach this goal, the value is put in people. This all begins by hiring intrinsically motivated people. To support them in doing their best work, they are given: (i) a higher goal to strive for together, (ii) autonomy to make their own decisions, and (iii) development opportunities to further improve their skills and knowledge. Apart from this, to allow them to work optimally, process improvement is what Modderkolk continuously invests in.  
                        </p>
                        <p>My project was formed to address the struggle in planning and organization of projects. The challenge is caused by multiple start and stop times within, and especially between, the <span><a href="#img-processes">processes that make up the production of control panel cabinets</a></span>. This is a bottleneck in the efficiency of our production process. If the processes that make up the production of electrical control panel cabinets can be well-integrated, the production time of a cabinet can be shortened from one month to within one week. This can provide time to better plan projects and organize resources.

                    For an efficient production process, we have developed a <span><a href="#img-vision">vision</a></span> of a fully automated production line. This robot-led process collects data from various points throughout the production process to produce real-time insights. This data can have value in understanding how to further improve the planning and organization of our projects.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Apart from decreased production lead time, other benefits can be expected from automation. Production errors can be reduced, resulting in an increased quality of panel cabinets. Challenges in finding people to fill job functions in the production hall will also be addressed. For employees already working on the floor, the robot will take over repetitive tasks. This will give more time for the employees to complete tasks that should give them higher job satisfaction.

                        <br>
                        2. To have a user-tested system with end-users (logistics employees). 
                        <br>
                        3. To have a database of images of materials.</p>

                        <p class="mb-15">I did not completely reach the goals that were set, but I am still very satisfied with the progress that has been made. More insights were generated than I expected and I have gained an understanding of the project on multiple levels – technical software and systems, business, and the in-betweens. One of the most important achievements for me is in connecting the dots between the larger vision of the project to the part that I am working on (for the logistics process). Over the past year, I have grown to understand my project more and can create a story that binds the scope of the company values to the project vision to various sub-projects.

                        <p class="mb-15">
                        As for the development goal (<span><a href="#project-goals">Goal No. 1</a></span>), I have come to realize that the initial goal was not specific enough. It does not relate the frequency to the accuracy and could be interpreted as having a 95% confidence (<span style="font-style: italic;">accuracy</span>) for 100% of the predictions made (<span style="font-style: italic;">frequency</span>). In the end, what I have achieved is a correct classification, of varying confidence (<span style="font-style: italic;">accuracy</span>), for over 95% of the predictions made for each object (<span style="font-style: italic;">frequency</span>). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-15">
                        Nevertheless, I have also come to realize that the main challenge for a proof of concept is not to have a super accurate model, but to have a working overall system. At an initial stage, it is better to focus on the design of the system, as the model can always be better trained at a later stage. In the beginning, I was too focused on trying to train a good classification model. The flaw of this goal is that it focuses too much on the performance of just a part of the system and not the system as a whole. Once I shifted my focus off from model training, I was able to achieve more results in developing a system for the proof of concept. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-15">
                        I have managed to create an initial proof of concept system in which an implementation has been integrated into the company’s ERP system. During the development process, I have involved the logistics employees who are the intended end-users. This was done through a value stream mapping workshop to better understand how they work and where the “pain” points are in their workflow. Some of these points were taken into account for the development. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-15">
                        This system has not yet been tested with the intended end-users, which means that I did not reach the <span><a href="#project-goals">second goal</a></span>. With the system having a knowledge base of only 9 components, we thought that it would not yet be a good time to test the system with the end-users. Testing the system with them now would show how inefficient using the technology can be and could create a negative experience. We want to avoid this, as we would like to already help them make a smooth transition towards a robotic production line. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-15">
                        A plan has been made for the implementation of an image data collection system that will involve the end-users as co-creators. The plan is to have this system deployed by the end of August 2019. This initiative will provide a basis to communicate the project vision to the logistics employees. It will also grow the knowledge base for the object recognition system, making it more usable. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-15">
                        The data collection system will also further advance the <span><a href="#project-goals">third goal</a></span>, which is at the moment achieved to a certain degree. There is a collection of images for the 9 components. There is also a system that generates more images that can be used for model training (<span><a href="https://peltarion.com/knowledge-center/documentation/modeling-view/build-an-ai-model/image-augmentation" target="_blank">data augmentation</a></span>). The next step would be to create a pipeline that can continuously update this database for future model retraining.</p>

                                    I learned a lot through various online courses on machine learning and computer vision and following online tutorials. It was a matter of finding which technology aspect I needed for my project, then learning it through hands-on application (trial & error). One of the challenges was determining the extent to which I should follow a course or tutorial. I have learned to be conscious of what I am learning and asking myself how this applies to my situation. Learning with experts during the New Engineers week also really helped to solidify what I have learned by myself.

                                    Learning process design involved a lot of feedback from other people. I would model systems and processes in various ways and on various levels. I would also iteratively get feedback and improve the diagrams. At times, I fell short when I would overthink on small details. I’ve learned that it is important to set scopes and make assumptions (and manage them).

                                    Learning more about design thinking and innovation processes helped to see development from another perspective (beyond codes and programs). There are multiple tools to help generate ideas and solutions. Sometimes when looking for solutions throughout the project, I think too much and do too much research, spending too much time in deciding on a method/strategy.

                                    I’ve had the chance this past year to practice this skill through application of various techniques. From verbal communication to communicating through documents. What really helped is to try out different things and see how people react to it. For example, explaining things with words vs with images. I’ve learned the importance of using stories to communicate. The times where I’ve come short in communication was usually when I have not yet structured my thoughts well enough.

                            Other things that I can work on improving on is in being more entrepreneurial – from leading to the enterprising spirit. I sometimes underestimate my own qualities and often allow others to make decisions too often. I have the capabilities to bring others along and I should exercise that more. To speak out to lead the group and not just to give an opinion is still something I could do more of.

                            I need to work on knowing when it is important to double-check so much, as it sometimes hinders my decision making. This also has to do with being more daring to take risks. Taking actions is not hard for me, but sometimes taking risks is. I will eventually need to grow in this skill to further reach my ambitions of growing an innovative team.

                        <p class="mb-15">New Engineers has provided me a basis to further develop myself. What is valuable is not only the knowledge that I have attained in this past year, but the way of thinking and the attitude of taking ownership.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-15">
                        Even though some of the knowledge was not my core focus, they are still very useful skills that I have utilized and can see myself utilizing in the future, both in career and life. For example, facilitation skills. I've used some of those skills to help in preparing for meetings and am using it to help plan an innovation workshop. Techniques of NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) have also given me insights for communication.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-15">
                        Beyond all the knowledge, New Engineers has allowed me to develop in my soft skills, as well as my learning skills. A lot of times people don't question how you learn, but New Engineers has helped to sharpen my 'learning how to learn' skills. This, along with the attitudes that they have encouraged, has provided me the basic bundle to continue to develop beyond an engineer.
